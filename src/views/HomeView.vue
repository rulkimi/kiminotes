        This is my personal collection of coding notes. It's a compilation of everything I've coded, organized into one
        website for quick and easy reference. No more endless scrolling through GitHub to find what I’ve done before —
        now I have all my work documented here in one place.

        You might wonder, "Why not just use apps like Notion or Obsidian?" Well, while they’re great, it’s tricky to
        simulate code I've already worked on in those apps. And honestly, where's the fun in that? Hehe :P Building this site lets
        me relive my projects and keep things exciting!
